# Memory Allocation in C

## What is Dynamic Memory?  
Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocation of memory space at the run time.

## Stack
The stack is a LIFO data strucutre. It's size increases when the program moves forward.

Stack Overflow: When a stack gets exhaused due to bad programming skills or some logical error, the phoenomenon is known as Stack Overflow.

## Heap
Heap is a tree-based data structure. It's size increases when we allocate memory dynamically. To use the heap data structure, we have to create a pointer in our main function that will point to some memory block in a heap.
