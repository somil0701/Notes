## Introduction to functions

A <b>function</b> is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
The function initiating the function call is the <b>caller</b>, and the function being called is the <b>callee</b> or <b>called</b> function.

```cpp
returnType functionName() // This is the function header (tells the compiler about the existence of the function)
{
    // This is the function body (tells the compiler what the function does)
}
```

The first line is informally called the <b>function header</b>, and it tells the compiler about the existence of a function, the function's name, etc.

the curly braces and statements in-between are called the <b>function body</b>.
