# CSS Designing

## CSS Display
This property specifies and determines how an element would be displayed on the website.

### Display Inline
It only takes the space required for the content, leaving the rest space for other elements to come.
```css
syntax{
    display: inline;
}
```

### Display Block
It takes the full width availabe across the website page leaving a new line before and after the element.
```css
syntax{
    display: block;
}
```

### Display Inline Block
This property is quite similar to inline but dimension proeprties are allowed in the case of inline-block display.

### Display None & Hidden
This proeprty removes the element from the document, clearing the space taken by the element. When the display is hidden, thought the element isn't visible the space is still taken by the element.
